              <p><strong><em>Pollution Regulation and Local Firm Productivity Growth</em></strong>, with Wenjie Wu and Yanwen Yun, draft available upon request</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper evaluates the impact of China’s first air pollution regulation on firm productivity growth. We compile a comprehensive dataset to follow identical firms over a ten-year period since the policy implementation. Utilizing the instrumental variable of power plant suitability to predict the treatment of environmental regulation, we find that firms located in strictly regulated counties experience slower productivity growth relative to firms in less regulated counties. The IV estimates are twice the magnitude of corresponding OLS estimates. Firm and spatial heterogeneity of the regulatory effect are also explored.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent around the world. Urban residents in developing countries have become more vulnerable to health shocks due to poor sanitation and infrastructure. This paper is the first to empirically measure the relationship between weather and health shocks in the urban context of a developing country. Using unique high-frequency datasets of weekly cholera cases and accumulated precipitation for wards in Dar es Salaam, we find robust evidence that extreme rainfall has a significant positive impact on weekly cholera incidence. The effect is larger in wards that are more prone to flooding, have higher shares of informal housing and unpaved roads. We identify limited spatial spillovers. Time-dynamic effects suggest cumulated rainfall increases cholera occurrence immediately and with a lag of up to 5 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines the impact of environmental regulations on the local labor markets by exploiting China’s first air pollution regulation as a natural experiment. The identification strategy uses a new instrumental variable proposed based on engineering considerations related to polluting activities. The results, based on aggregated firm and census data, show that the pollution regulation led to a decline in employment in the targeted prefectures and sectors by causing net firm exits. Analyses at the worker level, using census data with rich individual characteristics, further reveal the distributional consequences of this adverse effect by skill level, such that less educated workers are more likely to have lost their jobs. Moreover, less educated workers are less likely to have spatially adjusted to other labor markets due to the high and skill-biased migration costs imposed by the <em>hukou</em> system.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines political favoritism of cites in national capital markets and the effect of that favoritism on city sizes. The paper estimates the city-by-city variation in the prices of capital across cities in China from 1998 to 2007. It relates how the prices facing the highest order political units and overall cross-city price dispersion change with changes in national policy and leadership. The effect of capital market favoritism on city growth after the national relaxation of migration restrictions in the early 2000’s is investigated. The elasticity of the city growth rate with respect to the price of capital is estimated to be - 0.07 in the OLS approach and -0.12 in the IV approach.</p>

              <h4 id="Why-Emacs"><a href="#Why-Emacs" class="headerlink" title="Why Emacs?"></a>Why Emacs?</h4><p>I spent a long time trying to find a Notepad++ equivalent for Mac OS. As recommended by others, I have tried TextWrangler, Smultron, and TextMate (the trial/free version, of course). Among the above mentioned, I liked TextWrangler the most. But in one way or another, they can’t match the same level of user-friendliness of Notepad++ on Windows.</p>
<p>This frustration led me to step into the realm of real programmers and start learning to use Aquamacs (based on GNU Emacs but has Mac-looking interface). For starters, it is certainly more difficult to learn than Notepad++. However, it is great for editing STATA do-files, TeX files, R scripts (which Aquamacs can run internally), etc. It is, in my opinion, also the best free TeX editor for both Windows and Mac OS. You could also use it to compare files, which comes in handy if you want to tell apart similar do-files. And these are just the tip of the iceberg of what Aquamacs is capable of. In short, Aquamacs will be worth your investment (of time) in the long run.</p>
<p><em>This note only offers a few useful links. If you run into trouble with any of them, or find anything difficult to follow, feel free to get in touch with me via email.</em></p>
<p>Set up Aquamacs: Download and install <a href="http://aquamacs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aquamacs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Getting started with Aquamacs:</strong> is essentially the same as Emacs. Therefore, almost all Emacs help files apply to Aquamacs. A thorough introduction by Jeremy Zawodny can be found <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Emacs-Beginner-HOWTO.html#toc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The most useful chapters for me are 2, 4, and 5. Make sure you follow through the tutorials closely.</p>
<p><strong>Integrating with Stata:</strong> unfortunately Stata does not come as a default Emacs mode. But thanks to Bill Rising and his ado-mode, this is made possible and simple. Please follow his tutorial <a href="http://louabill.org/Stata/send2stata.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Integrating with LaTeX:</strong> Tex mode comes as default with Emacs, and made better with the AUCTeX extension <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

It also comes with productivity enhancing functions like ‘find and replace’, ‘move current line up/down’, ‘block commenting’, ‘record/play macro’, etc. You could also split windows to view two do-files concurrently (right click tab and choose ‘move to other view’), or see one do-file in two split windows (right click tab and choose ‘clone to other view’) to view different sections without scrolling. </p>

<li><strong>Tab, Shft-Tab:</strong> add (without Shft) and remove (with Shft) indentation for current line (or selection). This makes layers of loop easy to read.</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-F/H:</strong> find/replace. Its pop-up window also has advanced find/replace options.</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shft-Up/Down:</strong> move the current line (or selection) up/down. This beats copying and pasting.</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shft-U, Ctrl-U:</strong> convert current line (or selection) to upper case with Shft, and lower case without Shft.</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shft-Q, Ctrl-Q:</strong> stream comment current line (or selection) with Shft (wich is /* */ in STATA), and block comment/uncomment without Shft (which is *).</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shft-R, Ctrl-Shft-P:</strong> start/stop to record macro (with R) and play recorded macro (with P). This set of functions are extremely helpful for repetitive tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-G:</strong> brings a window for you to type in the line number that you want to go to.</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-B:</strong> go to matching brace.<br>Alt-Left mouse click: column selection instead of row selection.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bottom line: if you’re a frequent STATA user but not a hardcore programmer (they have Vim and such), coding with Notepad++ will make you more efficient.</em></p>

<li><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download</a> the latest Notepad++ and install it.</li>
<li>Set up hot keys to pass code from Notepad++ to STATA (like Ctrl-D in STATA’s editor).<ul>
<li>Follow <a href="https://huebler.blogspot.com/search?q=notepad%2B%2B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this instruction by Friedrich Huebler</a>. Or,</li>
<li>In the case where you get your new version of STATA before Huebler gets to update his files (for STATA 12, there was a 2-month lag), then knowing how to create your own ‘rundo’ programs through <a href="https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AutoIt</a> will solve your problem. See <a href="https://github.com/kkranker/notepad-stats-integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this instruction by Keith Kranker</a> for details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up syntax highlighting: it makes writing do-file more fun and reading it much easier. Below is a snapshot of how it looks. I suggest you download a ready-made syntax file (e.g., <a href="https://gist.github.com/bquistorff/4229749e85c90e45ddc9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a>) and modify it according to your own liking.</li>

<h4 id="Here-are-the-steps"><a href="#Here-are-the-steps" class="headerlink" title="Here are the steps:"></a>Here are the steps:</h4><ul>
<li>Save the syntax highlighting file in .xml format.</li>
<li>In Notepad++, click on ‘Language’ on your toolbar, and select ‘Define your language’. In the pop-up window, click on ‘Import’ and navigate to the directory where you saved the xml file. You should see ‘Import successful’.</li>
<li>You can customize all the options to assign colors of your choice to different specifications. Either way, remember to save it and give it a name, say ‘STATA syntax’.</li>
<li>Restart Notepad++, and open a do file.</li>
<li>Go to the ‘Language’ option and click on ‘STATA syntax’, or whatever name you used.</li>
<li>From now on, any do-file you open with Notepad++ will have Stata syntax highlighting. You can also set it as your default do-file editor, if you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You could also setup auto-completion and/or spell-check, but I think they’re a bit of an overkill (still, see <a href="https://github.com/kkranker/notepad-stats-integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kranker’s</a> page for more details).</em></p>

              <p>Most of us first encountered STATA in an Econometrics class. We were given cleaned datasets and detailed do-files. Using STATA was merely mechanical cutting and pasting. Granted, the goal of these computer sessions was to interpret regression results rather than to learn STATA.</p>
<p>So when I wrote my first quantitative essay with original data, I did all the analysis interactively without using do-files. It was not until my first RA job that I realized all the days I spent typing on STATA command window with extreme caution (knowing there is no ‘undo’ in STATA) were utterly inefficient. I would even admit that my first ever -merge- was done semi-manually… Looking back, weeks of silly tedious manual work could have been done in just one day, if I had known how to use STATA properly.</p>
<p>Here are some very very helpful STATA tutorial pages from which I learned how to use STATA the right way. I hope these links could help you get there without going through a detour like I did.</p>
